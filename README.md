# Pothole Detection using RetinaNet and Faster R-CNN

🚀 A deep learning-based project comparing RetinaNet and Faster R-CNN (ResNet-50 & ResNet-100) for pothole detection.
📌 Project Overview

    Implemented object detection models for pothole detection.
    
    Compared RetinaNet and Faster R-CNN (ResNet-50 & ResNet-100).
    
    Used PyTorch & Detectron2 for training and evaluation.
    
    Evaluated performance using Precision, Recall, and mAP (mean Average Precision).
    

🔍 Dataset

    Used an annotated pothole dataset (source: [[Link if public](https://public.roboflow.com/object-detection/pothole)]).
    
    Preprocessed images with augmentation techniques.
    
    70/20/10 train-valid-test split.
